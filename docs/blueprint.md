## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC) to reflect Japandi's neutral tones.
- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAFA), subtly desaturated version of beige to keep with the calm, minimalist style.
- Accent color: A muted green (#A9BC8A), to subtly introduce organic, natural elements without overpowering the calm beige tones.
- Font pairing: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text paired with 'Literata' (serif) for headings.
- Use minimalist line icons that match the Japandi style. Use consistent stroke weights and a neutral color palette.
- Employ a clean, spacious layout with generous use of white space to emphasize simplicity. Use a grid system to align elements.
